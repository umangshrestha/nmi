This is my ambitious project to create a programming language from scratch. I named it <b>New Modern Interpretor</b>. 
I am heavily following "Writing an Interpretor in GO" by Throston Ball.

Everything I do will be blogged [here](https://medium.com).

Right now these are the things I defined.

Supported data types:

Binding Values to variables:<br/>
`let name = "Apple";` <br/>
`let price = 2.0;`<br/>
`let quantity = 3;`<br/>
`
