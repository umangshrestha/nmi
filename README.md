This is my ambitious project to create a programming language from scratch. I named it <b>New Modern Interpretor</b>. It is currently build on top of python. Once I am done experimenting, I pan to  convert it into rust or c. 

Everything I do will be blogged in [here](https://medium.com).

Right now these are the things I defined.
