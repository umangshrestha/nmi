This is my ambitious project to create a programming language from scratch. I named it <b>New Modern Interpretor</b>. It is currently build on top of python. Once I am don experimenting, I pan to  convert it into rust or c. 

Everything I do will be blogged [here](https://medium.com).

Right now these are the things I defined.

Binding Values to variables:<br/>
`let name = "Apple";` <br/>
`let price = 2.0;`<br/>
`let quantity = 3;`<br/>
`
